I needed a new challenge to push me in ways I hadn&#x2019;t been before.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when I conversed with my mentor, Ming, who was part of the larger SAS Robotics program. We talked about potential summer projects, and when the MATE ROV competition came up, I instantly knew this was it. I wanted to build something that would push us beyond what we thought possible.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F4A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">A little about the MATE ROV competition: it&apos;s a global challenge in which teams build remote-operated underwater vehicles to tackle simulated marine tasks, such as repairing cables, collecting data, and testing their engineering and problem-solving skills.</div></div><p>Two months later, I had a team ready to take on the challenge. With our FRC experience, I thought it would be smooth sailing. I was wrong. This wouldn&#x2019;t be easy&#x2014;it would test everything we knew.</p><p>And so began the journey of RED V&#x2014;a journey that would stretch our limits, push our capabilities, and teach us more than we ever expected.</p><h1 id="phase-ii-think-think-think">Phase II: Think! Think! Think!</h1><h2 id="story">Story</h2><p>Procrastination hit us hard. What was supposed to be a well-paced design process turned into a mad dash as deadlines loomed. With time running out, I locked myself in my room, determined to bring order to the chaos. I dove into the MATE ROV rulebook, searching for a way to simplify our approach. After days of intense focus, I distilled our strategy into three guiding principles: modularity, adaptability, and simplicity.</p><div class="kg-card kg-toggle-card" data-kg-toggle-state="close">

        </div><p>With these principles in mind, I spent a week CAD designing the entire robot. It was a race against time, balancing the need for precision with the urgency of our deadline. My team, eager but inexperienced, took on the basic tasks, allowing me to focus on the critical decisions. Their support kept us moving, even as the pressure mounted.</p><p>Despite the challenges, we emerged with a solid plan. The design was complete, and we were ready to move on to the next phase: building RED V. The most challenging part was still ahead, but we had a clear direction&#x2014;and that was enough to keep us going.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F631;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">Storytelling is done - now the technical details &#x2620;&#xFE0F;</div></div><h2 id="21-robot-specifications">2.1 Robot Specifications</h2><p>RED V is a compact ROV, measuring 47.5 cm x 34 cm x 32.5 cm and weighing 6.2 kg with the tether.

The electronics are protected in a waterproof box, ensuring everything works underwater.

To achieve this, I explored complex shapes like octagons and dodecahedrons, but these proved too complicated to build and program. After multiple iterations, I found that a cuboid was the most straightforward and space-efficient design.</p><p>The decision to use 20x20 mm T-slot aluminium rails, inspired by my 3D printer, provided the perfect balance of lightness and strength. This modular design allowed us to easily swap out components, adjust positions, and optimize the robot as needed.</p><p>This choice paid off when I used robust, cost-effective 90-degree steel plates, enabling us to assemble the frame in under 30 minutes. The modular setup also made it easy to add 3D-printed legs to reduce stress on the manipulator and bottom camera and adjust buoyancy late in the season.</p><h2 id="23-manipulator">2.3 Manipulator</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building Red V: An Underwater ROV Project" loading="lazy" width="1983" height="764" srcset="http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png 600w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png 1000w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png 1600w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png 1983w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Early on, I recognized that a reliable manipulator was crucial, as it&#x2019;s the only component directly interacting with the props. Due to limited time and the challenges of prototyping a new claw design, I drew inspiration from the well-established Blue Robotics subsea gripper. However, I made key adaptations, incorporating 3D-printed parts and aluminium CNC plates secured with screws and threaded inserts to enhance durability and simplify repairs.</p><p>While I initially considered using a lead screw design similar to Blue Robotics, I ultimately chose a slider-crank mechanism powered by an affordable waterproof servo (LW-25MG) for its ease of waterproofing and assembly. To add versatility, I integrated a second LW-25MG servo with a gear system to rotate the gripper. This allowed the claw to adjust angles for different tasks&#x2014;vertical for inter-ray cable work and horizontal for seagrass pruning. To improve grip, I lined the manipulator&#x2019;s edges with rubber tape.</p><p>The LW-25MG servo, with its high torque of 25 kg and built-in waterproofing, was ideal for quickly and reliably operating the claw. This setup ensured the manipulator could handle various tasks without losing grip. Ultimately, I built a functional and cost-effective claw for $143.68, which offers more functionality at a fraction of the cost of the Newton Subsea Gripper ($590).</p><h2 id="24-buoyancy-system">2.4 Buoyancy System</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--3-.svg" class="kg-image" alt="Building Red V: An Underwater ROV Project" loading="lazy" width="612" height="330"></figure><p>Achieving neutral buoyancy was crucial for RED V to maintain stable and precise control underwater, allowing the robot to remain in place without constantly fighting gravity or buoyancy. The buoyancy system was designed using PVC pipes with a 63 mm outer diameter, chosen for their consistent buoyant force across varying depths and ease of mounting.</p><div class="kg-card kg-toggle-card" data-kg-toggle-state="close">

This setup allows RED V to move forward and backwards and translate left and right efficiently. Additionally, parallel to the ROV, two thrusters are mounted on opposite sides of the frame to control vertical movement and provide fine adjustments to pitch and roll.</p><p>This X-shaped configuration was selected for its ability to maximize degrees of freedom while minimizing the number of thrusters. This balances power requirements and keeps the system cost-effective. The load is evenly distributed among the four primary thrusters, ensuring stability and smooth control during complex manoeuvres.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-red"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F6A8;</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Pitch Control and Software Integration</strong></b><br>While the X-shaped thruster configuration provides excellent control, it does have limited pitch control.

Combined with the carefully calibrated buoyancy system, this setup ensures that RED V remains stable and precise in all its movements.</div></div><h3 id="thrust-capabilities"><strong>Thrust Capabilities</strong></h3><p>Each T-60 thruster generates 1.65 kg of thrust, sufficient to meet the competition&apos;s requirements, including lifting a maximum load of 1 kg. The choice of T-60 thrusters ($50) over the more expensive Blue Robotics T200 thrusters ($200) was made to maintain cost-effectiveness without compromising performance. The T-60 thrusters are also more compact, making them an ideal fit for RED V&apos;s design.</p><h3 id="mounting-and-modularity"><strong>Mounting and Modularity</strong></h3><p>The thrusters are mounted using 3D-printed brackets that slide into the T-slot aluminium frame. This modular design allows for quick and easy replacements or adjustments, ensuring issues can be resolved swiftly with minimal downtime. Replacing a thruster in minutes is critical in maintaining operational readiness during competition.</p><h1 id="phase-iii-tangle-me-to-death">Phase III: Tangle Me to Death...</h1><h2 id="story-1">Story</h2><p>The initial design phase felt like a breeze. Every detail was meticulously planned, down to the last screw, and we felt unstoppable. Supply issues? Minor hiccups. We were so confident that we even joked about finishing within a month&#x2014;oh, how naive we were.</p><p>Then came the electronics phase. It seemed simple enough: connect some wires, do a bit of soldering, and voil&#xE0;, we&#x2019;re done. Or so we thought. Little did we know that electronics&#x2014;especially waterproofing&#x2014;would become our worst nightmare.</p><p>Water, that seemingly harmless liquid, became our biggest enemy. The number of components we fried due to the tiniest leaks was staggering. Every mistake, no matter how small, sets us back significantly.</p><p>Our problems all boiled down to a few seemingly minor design flaws. First, our initial design had a horizontal plate blocking components&apos; access, making repairs a nightmare. Then, there was a tiny protrusion beyond the box&#x2019;s limit&#x2014;barely noticeable, but it let water seep in like a flood.</p><p>Our solution? We went vertical. We redesigned the layout to ensure nothing protruded beyond the waterproof box.

The first version of the system was plagued with problems such as poor soldering, suboptimal cable management, and the use of spade connectors, all of which contributed to frequent leaks and made the system nearly impossible to repair efficiently. This version also used horizontal CNC plates that further complicated access to the electronics, making repairs a daunting task.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--6-.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building Red V: An Underwater ROV Project" loading="lazy" width="1913" height="1031" srcset="http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Untitled-design--6-.png 600w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Untitled-design--6-.png 1000w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Untitled-design--6-.png 1600w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--6-.png 1913w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">OLD</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>To resolve these issues, the second iteration introduced a much-improved design. The electronics are now housed in a larger, more spacious Bopla Bocube (210 x 191 mm x 90 mm), a weatherproof box that offers better protection and easier access. One of the key innovations in this redesign was the introduction of 3D-printed vertical plates, which replaced the horizontal configuration. These vertical plates allow the electronics to be easily slid in and out of the racks, significantly simplifying the process of making repairs or modifications.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--5-.png" class="kg-image" alt="Building Red V: An Underwater ROV Project" loading="lazy" width="1913" height="1031" srcset="http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Untitled-design--5-.png 600w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Untitled-design--5-.png 1000w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Untitled-design--5-.png 1600w, http://madhavlodha.com/content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--5-.png 1913w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">NEW</strong></b></figcaption></figure><p>The modularity of this new setup was enhanced by using bullet connectors and DuPont cables, allowing components to be connected and disconnected easily.

But I often focused on design and management, more out of circumstance than choice (there&#x2019;s a funny story about that in my FIRST Robotics blog [link it here]).</p><p>This MATE season, I decided it was time to dive into coding. Even though we had a programming lead, I wanted to get involved. As it turned out, our lead was overwhelmed and swamped, so I stepped in to help, thinking I&#x2019;d be doing something simple like 2+2 = 4 (that&#x2019;s a joke), not realizing what I was getting into. Suddenly, I was in charge of the robot&#x2019;s computer vision.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t just basic coding. I had to learn OpenCV, integrate a YOLO v5 model, and even build a neural network to detect dead or alive fish&#x2014;a task I didn&#x2019;t fully understand but tackled anyway. My experience with Arduino and Raspberry Pi helped, but this was a new challenge. After a weekend of intense learning, I got the system working&#x2014;albeit messily. The code was hard to decipher, and our GitHub repo was riddled with funny but useless commit messages, so our lead wasn&#x2019;t thrilled, but we were both happy with the results.</p><p>I also took on designing the GUI using Tkinter, which was a pain, but learning Figma brought me back to familiar territory. The GUI turned out well, adding another layer of functionality to the project.</p><p>Looking back, this phase marked a shift for me. I&#x2019;ve always wanted to explore every field, and this gave me the new challenge I needed. It showed me that great hardware needs a solid foundation in software, and I&#x2019;m excited to focus more on coding moving forward.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x1F631;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">Storytelling is done - now the technical details &#x2620;&#xFE0F;</div></div><h2 id="41-basic-control-software">4.1 Basic Control Software</h2><p>Our robot&#x2019;s key functions, like movement and manipulator control, are managed by the Ardusub system from Blue Robotics. This setup includes a Raspberry Pi as the companion computer, a Pixhawk 2.4.8 as the autopilot, and a topside control station.</p><p>Since ArduSub uses the MAVLink protocol, we employed the Pymavlink library with the mavutil module in Python to handle communications. We created movement functions and consolidated them into a single file for easy import, reducing redundancy and simplifying debugging.</p><p>We chose Ardusub for its reliability and strong community support, which minimized issues and kept the project on schedule.</p><h2 id="42">4.2 </h2>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
