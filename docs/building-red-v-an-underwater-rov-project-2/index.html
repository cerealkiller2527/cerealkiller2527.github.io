I needed a new challenge that would push me in ways I hadn’t been pushed before.</p><p>That’s when I conversed with my mentor, Ming, who was part of the larger SAS Robotics program. We talked about potential summer projects, and when the MATE ROV competition came up, I knew instantly that this was it. I wanted to build something that would push us beyond what we thought possible.</p><p>Two months later, I had a team ready to take on the challenge. With our FRC experience, I thought it would be smooth sailing. I was wrong. This wasn’t going to be easy—it would test everything we knew.</p><p>And so began the journey of RED V—a journey that would stretch our limits, push our capabilities, and teach us more than we ever expected.</p><h1 id="phase-ii-think-think-think">Phase II: Think! Think! Think!</h1><p>Procrastination hit us hard. What was supposed to be a well-paced design process turned into a mad dash as deadlines loomed. With time running out, I locked myself in my room, determined to bring order to the chaos. I dove into the MATE ROV rulebook, searching for a way to simplify our approach.

        </div><p>With these principles in mind, I spent a week CAD designing the entire robot. It was a race against time, balancing the need for precision with the urgency of our deadline. My team, eager but inexperienced, took on the basic tasks, allowing me to focus on the critical decisions. Their support kept us moving, even as the pressure mounted.</p><p>Despite the challenges, we emerged with a solid plan. The design was complete, and we were ready to move on to the next phase: building RED V. The toughest part was still ahead, but we had a clear direction—and that was enough to keep us going.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">😱</div><div class="kg-callout-text">Storytelling is done - now the technical details ☠️</div></div><h2 id="21-robot-specifications">2.1 Robot Specifications</h2><p>RED V is a compact ROV, measuring 47.5 cm x 34 cm x 32.5 cm and weighing 6.2 kg with the tether. Its sturdy aluminium frame makes it easy to adjust and repair. With six thrusters, RED V moves smoothly and precisely. The electronics are protected in a waterproof box, ensuring everything works underwater. I Designed to be simple and adaptable, RED V is ready to destroy the competition (or so I thought).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2024/08/ORCA-Robotics---MATE-Technical-Documentation.svg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="656" height="261"></figure><h2 id="22-frame">2.2 Frame</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--2-.svg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="612" height="330"></figure><p>Using the fewest thrusters possible, I aimed to achieve superior thrust vector control with six degrees of freedom. Initially, we explored complex shapes like octagons and dodecahedrons, but these proved too complicated to build and program. After multiple iterations, I found that a cuboid was the most straightforward and space-efficient design.</p><p>The decision to use 20x20 mm T-slot aluminium rails, inspired by our 3D printer, provided the perfect balance of lightness and strength. This modular design allowed us to easily swap out components, adjust positions, and optimize the robot as needed.</p><p>This choice paid off when I used robust, cost-effective 90-degree steel plates, enabling us to assemble the frame in under 30 minutes. The modular setup also made it easy to add 3D-printed legs to reduce stress on the manipulator and bottom camera and adjust buoyancy late in the season.</p><h2 id="23-manipulator">2.3 Manipulator</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1983" height="764" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png 1600w, ../content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-15-181736-1.png 1983w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Early on, I recognized that a reliable manipulator was crucial, as it’s the only component directly interacting with the props. Due to limited time and the challenges of prototyping a new claw design, I drew inspiration from the well-established Blue Robotics subsea gripper. However, I made key adaptations, incorporating 3D-printed parts and aluminium CNC plates secured with screws and threaded inserts to enhance durability and simplify repairs.</p><p>While I initially considered using a lead screw design similar to Blue Robotics, I ultimately chose a slider-crank mechanism powered by an affordable waterproof servo (LW-25MG) for its ease of waterproofing and assembly. To add versatility, I integrated a second LW-25MG servo with a gear system to rotate the gripper. This allowed the claw to adjust angles for different tasks—vertical for inter-ray cable work and horizontal for seagrass pruning. To improve grip, I lined the manipulator’s edges with rubber tape.</p><p>The LW-25MG servo, with its high torque of 25 kg and built-in waterproofing, was ideal for quickly and reliably operating the claw. This setup ensured the manipulator could handle various tasks without losing grip. Ultimately, I built a functional and cost-effective claw for $143.68, which offers more functionality at a fraction of the cost of the Newton Subsea Gripper ($590).</p><h2 id="24-buoyancy-system">2.4 Buoyancy System</h2><h2 id=""></h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--3-.svg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="612" height="330"></figure><p>Achieving neutral buoyancy was crucial for RED V to maintain stable and precise control underwater. The buoyancy system was designed using PVC pipes with a 63 mm outer diameter, chosen for their consistent buoyant force across varying depths and ease of mounting.</p><div class="kg-card kg-toggle-card" data-kg-toggle-state="close">

        </div><p>This adjustment ensured that the ROV remained neutrally buoyant.</p><h4 id="practical-adjustments"><strong>Practical Adjustments</strong></h4><p>To counterbalance the added weight of the manipulator at the front of the ROV, smaller PVC pipes with a 23 mm outer diameter were added. This prevented the ROV from tilting forward, keeping it level and stable during operation.</p><p>The PVC pipes were mounted using custom CNC plates and locally purchased angular gussets, allowing for easy adjustments and repositioning as needed. This setup also allowed the buoyancy tubes to pivot out of the way for quick access to the electronics and repairs.</p><p>By carefully calculating and adjusting the buoyancy system, RED V maintained neutral buoyancy, enhancing its manoeuvrability and stability in the water.</p><h2 id="25-propulsion">2.5 Propulsion</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--4-.svg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="612" height="330"></figure><p>RED V is powered by six T-60 thrusters strategically arranged to provide optimal thrust vector control with six degrees of freedom. The propulsion system was carefully designed to ensure precise and intuitive manoeuvrability.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2024/08/Untitled-design--6-.svg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="612" height="330"></figure><h4 id="thruster-arrangement"><strong>Thruster Arrangement</strong></h4><p>The propulsion system features four T-60 thrusters positioned at 45-degree angles within the cuboidal frame, forming an X-shaped configuration. This setup allows RED V to move forward and backwards and translate left and right efficiently. Additionally, parallel to the ROV, two thrusters are mounted on opposite sides of the frame to control vertical movement and provide fine adjustments to pitch and roll.</p><p>This X-shaped configuration was selected for its ability to maximize degrees of freedom while minimizing the number of thrusters. This balances power requirements and keeps the system cost-effective. The load is evenly distributed among the four primary thrusters, ensuring stability and smooth control during complex manoeuvres.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-red"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">🚨</div><div class="kg-callout-text"><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Pitch Control and Software Integration</strong></b><br>While the X-shaped thruster configuration provides excellent control, it does have limited pitch control. To address this, a gyroscope was integrated into the ROV's software, allowing for fine-tuned adjustments to maintain balance. Combined with the carefully calibrated buoyancy system, this setup ensures that RED V remains stable and precise in all its movements.</div></div><h4 id="thrust-capabilities"><strong>Thrust Capabilities</strong></h4><p>Each T-60 thruster generates 1.65 kg of thrust, sufficient to meet the competition's requirements, including lifting a maximum load of 1 kg. The choice of T-60 thrusters ($50) over the more expensive Blue Robotics T200 thrusters ($200) was made to maintain cost-effectiveness without compromising performance. The T-60 thrusters are also more compact, making them an ideal fit for RED V's design.</p><h4 id="mounting-and-modularity"><strong>Mounting and Modularity</strong></h4><p>The thrusters are mounted using 3D-printed brackets that slide into the T-slot aluminium frame. This modular design allows for quick and easy replacements or adjustments, ensuring issues can be resolved swiftly with minimal downtime. Replacing a thruster in minutes is critical in maintaining operational readiness during competition.</p>
